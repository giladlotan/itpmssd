- The rise of social media

_Technical Discussion_
- Graph properties help us understand relationship between items.
    - goals: divide population into groups, find important people within a group, predict how information will spread, etc..
    - concepts: connected components, triadic closure, small world networks, homophily, social ties, ...
    - graph properties: density, cc, centrality, partitioning (modularity) 
    - karate club: example graph + insight
- Example: Instagram social network graphs, co-tag graphs, geo-graphs

#### Assignments

_Technical_
- use IG or Twitter APIs to examine a network digitally. (group project?)
    - describe your data source
    - what are the items, what relationships are you looking at
    - what did you find?
    - trending topics

_Reading for Next Week_
- I strongly recommend buying/borrowing a copy of Robert Weiss, “Learning from Strangers” to read through. There's a copy on the floor that I donated to the library. Get a sense for interviewing techniques.
