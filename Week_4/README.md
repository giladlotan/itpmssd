_Social Discussion_: social media & networked publics
- Using Instagram to "see"

_Technical Discussion_
- Spend time analyzing Stop & Frisk dataset
    - Go over questions and answers from assignment
- This week we’ll be using API’s to access data from social media. Specifically, we’ll look at Instagram data, and ways in which we can analyze publicly shared posts.
- Access Instagram’s API, and load Instagram data into pandas DataFrames.

#### Assignments

_Technical_
- Get familiar with [this Twitter API code] (https://github.com/giladlotan/itpmssd/blob/master/Week_4/TwitterAPI.ipynb)
- Pick a hashtag that's actively used on both Twitter and Instagram, and complete the following tasks/questions in an ipython notebook that you submit to our shared Dropbox:
    1. Describe the two datasets:
        - how many items does each include
        - how many unique users?
        - what are the date ranges
    2. Create a single plot that displays both Number of Tweets and number of Instagram Posts over time for your chosen hashtag.
    3. Identify the Tweets with mosts Retweets, as well as the Tweet posted by a user who has the most number of followers from this dataset.
    4. Identify the IG posts that have the largest number of likes and the one that has the largest number of comments.
