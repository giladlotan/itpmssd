#### Assignments

_Technical_
- use IG or Twitter APIs to examine a network digitally.
    - describe your data source
    - what are the items, what relationships are you looking at
    - what did you find?
    - trending topics

_Reading for Next Week_
- I strongly recommend buying/borrowing a copy of Robert Weiss, “Learning from Strangers” to read through. There's a copy on the floor that I donated to the library. Get a sense for interviewing techniques.
