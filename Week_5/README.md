_Social Discussion_: social network analysis
- based on homework readings: Scott Feld, “The Focused Organization of Social Ties"; Mark Granovetter, “The Strength of Weak Ties” 
- Different types of networks (behavioral, social, articulated)

_Technical Discussion_
- Graph properties help us understand relationship between items.
    - goals: divide population into groups, find important people within a group, predict how information will spread, etc..
    - concepts: connected components, triadic closure, small world networks, homophily, social ties, ...
    - graph properties: density, cc, centrality
    - karate club: example graph + insight
- Example: co-class graph

#### Assignments

_Technical_
- Go over the last part of the Network Analysis notebook from class. Answer the following two questions (short, 1-2 paragraphs for each question):
    - Take a look at the series of code blocks below. The same action is taken on our class graph over a number of iterations. Explain what's going on here.

    - Describe what happens in the end. Do you have an explanation for why this would happen to the graph? What's the significance?

_Reading for Next Week_
- I strongly recommend buying/borrowing a copy of Robert Weiss, “Learning from Strangers” to read through. There's a copy on the floor that I donated to the library. Get a sense for interviewing techniques.
