_Social Discussion_: social network analysis
- based on homework readings: Scott Feld, “The Focused Organization of Social Ties"; Mark Granovetter, “The Strength of Weak Ties” 
- Different types of networks (behavioral, social, articulated)

_Technical Discussion_
- Graph properties help us understand relationship between items.
    - goals: divide population into groups, find important people within a group, predict how information will spread, etc..
    - concepts: connected components, triadic closure, small world networks, homophily, social ties, ...
    - graph properties: density, cc, centrality
    - karate club: example graph + insight
- Example: co-class graph

#### Assignments

_Technical_
- Go over the last part of the Network Analysis notebook from class. Answer the following two questions (short, 1-2 paragraphs for each question):
1. Take a look at the series of code blocks below. The same action is taken on our class graph over a number of iterations. Explain what's going on here.

2. Describe what happens in the end. Do you have an explanation for why this would happen to the graph? What's the significance?

_Reading for Next Week_
- I strongly recommend buying/borrowing a copy of Robert Weiss, “Learning from Strangers” to read through. There's a copy on the floor that I donated to the library. Get a sense for interviewing techniques.
