    "Again, choosing the appropriate layout for a graph proves to be revealing. What the figure laid out by FR shows is that there are two key nodes, node 1 (actually the karate club instructor) and node 34, (actually the club president), which are central to different groups within the club. The next figure uses the same layout and colors the two groups differently, based on Zachary’s data. As can be seen, the two subgroups Zachary found (which he called factions) correspond closely to the grouping the force-spring algorithm finds, based on the interconnectedness of the nodes. "
