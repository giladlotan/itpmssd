_Assignment Discussion_: 
- Each group will present their "seeing" assignment for 5 minutes, followed by a brief discussion by the class.

_Technical Discussion_
- Analyze two datasets:
  - Titanic
  - Stop & Frisk

- This week we’ll be using API’s to access data from social media. Specifically, we’ll look at Instagram data, and ways in which we can analyze publicly shared posts.
- Access Instagram’s API, and load Instagram data into pandas DataFrames.

_Social Discussion_
- Using Instagram to "see"

#### Assignments

_Technical_
- Ask a question of the "Stop and Frisk" dataset. Use that question to drive an analysis and plot a statistical relationship from the data.
- Submit an RTF (or PDF) file to Dropbox that includes: 1) what question did you ask?; 2) why did you ask that question?; 3) a plot of the data that you obtained; 4) a brief (~3-5 sentence) analysis of what you learned.
- You may do this assignment alone, in pairs, or in groups of 3. Your choice as to team. Not everyone will present next week, but everyone should be prepared to present.
- Put your question (at least) into the Assignments folder by Thursday at 7PM.
